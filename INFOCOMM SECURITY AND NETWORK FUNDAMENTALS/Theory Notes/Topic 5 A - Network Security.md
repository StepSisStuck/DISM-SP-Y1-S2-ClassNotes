# Attacks on networks
- Threat actors place a high priority on targeting networks in their attacks.
- Exploit a single network vulnerability can expose hunreds or thousands of systems to attack.
- Attacks that target a network or a process that relies on a network include:
  - Interception Attacks
  - Layer 2 Attacks
  - DNS Attacks
  - Distributed denial of Service Attacks (DDOS Attacks)
  - Malicious Codding and Scripting attacks

## Interception Attacks
- Interception attacks are attacks that capture data as it travels over a network.

### Examnple of Interception Attacks
- Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM)
  - In an MITM, a threat actor is positioned in a communication between two parties.
  - The goal of the attack is to intercept and alter the communication, example: ease dropping or impersonation of one of the parties.
  - Application used: Wireshark, Ettercap, Cain and Abel, and SSLStrip.

- A typical MITM attact have two phases:
  - The first phase is to intercept the communication.
  - The second phase is to decrypt the communication.
